# This is the Start of the Gym Website Project for Agile Development University project


The Gym Website Project is a project that aims to create a website for a gym. The website will be used to provide information about the gym, its services, and its facilities. The website will also be used to allow users to book appointments and make payments.

Users need to be able to create accounts and manage their profiles. They should also be able to view the gym's schedule and book classes. As well as amend subscriptions.
